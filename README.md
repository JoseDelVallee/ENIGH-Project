# üìä Salary Income Prediction in Mexican Households - ENIGH

This project aims to predict salary-based income in Mexican households using data from the National Survey of Household Income and Expenditure (ENIGH). A statistical regression approach is employed to estimate income based on sociodemographic and labor-related variables. The analysis seeks to generate useful insights for public policy design and socioeconomic research.
